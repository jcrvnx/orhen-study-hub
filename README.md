## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get ORHEN STUDY HUB running on your Linux system:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Python 3:** Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed. Check with `python3 --version`.
    *   **pip:** Python's package installer. Usually comes with Python. Check with `pip3 --version`.
    *   **git:** For cloning the repository. Install if needed (`sudo apt install git` or `sudo dnf install git`).
    *   **Target Applications:** Make sure the applications you want to launch (browsers, tools like `wavemon`, `nmap`, `wireshark`, your preferred text editor/terminal, etc.) are **already installed** on your system!

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jcrvnx/ORHEN-STUDY-HUB.git # <-- Replace 'ORHEN-STUDY-HUB' if your repo name is different!
    cd ORHEN-STUDY-HUB # <-- Navigate into the cloned directory
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the required Python libraries (`customtkinter` and `Pillow` for image handling):
    ```bash
    # It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment!
    # python3 -m venv venv
    # source venv/bin/activate

    pip3 install customtkinter Pillow

    # If you used a virtual environment, you can deactivate it when done:
    # deactivate
    ```
    *   **Important:** Install these packages as your **regular user**, not using `sudo`. Running the GUI as root is not recommended and might cause issues if the library wasn't installed for root.

4.  **(Potentially) Edit Tool Commands:**
    *   The script (`orhen_study_hub.py` or similar) contains hardcoded command names for launching applications (e.g., `google-chrome-stable`, `kate`, `gnome-terminal`).
    *   **You might need to edit these commands** within the Python script (look inside the `create_dashboard_frame` and `create_tools_frame` functions) to match the *exact* command names used on *your specific Linux distribution*. For example, your text editor might be `gedit` or `mousepad` instead of `kate`. Your terminal might be `konsole` or `xfce4-terminal`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/ORHEN-STUDY-HUB
    ```
2.  Run the main Python script:
    ```bash
    python3 orhen_study_hub.py # Or whatever you named the main script
    ```

The ORHEN STUDY HUB GUI should now launch!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

*   **Adding/Changing Launchers:** Modify the `browsers`, `utils`, and `linux_tools` dictionaries inside the `orhen_study_hub.py` script to add your own applications or change existing commands.
*   **Appearance:** Use the built-in **Settings** menu within the application to change themes and modes.
